2018-07-24 AUC Recognition Criteria Update
==========================================

During the `Rocky PTG <https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/UC-Rocky-PTG>`_ among
the many things we discussed was increasing the pool of AUCs. We identified
areas we believed AUCs could be added from and recently voted to approve these
additions. This resolution is to verify the vote and provide information as
needed on what was voted on.

**AUC Recognition Criteria**

Summary:

Criteria should be adjusted to be relevant to the state of the community today;
i.e. SIGs. We are quite possibly missing up to at least 500 contributors who
should be AUC eligible. We need to vote a) if the recommended additional pools
should be used, b) publish AUCs (consider those who select anonymous for user
survey), and c) official + unofficial should be eligible (there are some user
groups who are not official but still are healthy).

Additional Pools:

* User Survey - people who completed a deployment (~550)
* Ops midcycle attendees instead of just session moderators (~50)
* OpenStack Days organizers (~100)
* SIG users (as suggested by SIG leaders) (~25)
* Active WoO participants (~10)
* Active Diversity WG participants (~10)

**Notes:**

SIG leaders should provide active participants who should be AUC and will follow
process of extra-auc as Team and Working Group leaders do. For SIG, can we have
the SIG leader to update on the AUC list, for example:

* https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/I18nTeam/ATC_statistics
* https://review.openstack.org/#/c/532982/
* https://review.openstack.org/#/c/464051

While it is possibly extra work for the chairs/leaders it just seems right to
prefer having to provide a list of active members who deserve it than it not be
earned.

AUCs are required to be Foundation Members; this document does not supersede
existing requirements but seeks to at least augment them with additional pools
AUCs can be obtained from.

**Vote Results:**

Additional Pools:

* User Survey - People who completed a deployment (~550) - Y
* Ops Midcycle Session Moderators and Event Organizers (~30) - Y
* OpenStack Days Session Moderators and Event Organizers (~200) - Y
* SIG Users (as suggested by SIG leaders) (~25) - Y
* Active WoO Participants (~10) - Y
* Active Diversity WG Participants (~10) - Y
