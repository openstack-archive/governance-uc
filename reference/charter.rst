=================================
 OpenStack User Committee Charter
=================================

Mission
=======
The User Committee’s (UC) mission is to serve the user community of
OpenStack, representing them to the broader community (including the Technical
Committee, Board of Directors, Projects and PTLs, and projects outside
OpenStack). The UC recognizes competence and contribution, and when necessary
resolves disputes in accordance with the OpenStack Code of Conduct. The UC
keeps track of OpenStack deployments and usage, helping to share user stories
and experiences. The User Committee works with user groups worldwide to keep
the community vibrant and informed.

User Committee Members
======================
The User Committee (UC) will consist of five members. All members selected to
the UC shall be Individual Members and Active User Contributors (AUC) based on
the definition in the next section. A member of the UC may cease to be an
Individual Member during her or his term, but must be an Individual Member at
the time of nomination and election. The UC shall organize its meetings and
may, create elected seats to be filled by a vote of the Individual Members
recognized as AUCs. UC members shall terminate upon the death, resignation,
removal or failure to be re-elected to the UC. The procedures for such removal
shall be determined by the UC. Cause shall include (i) failure to attend more
than half of the UC meetings within any twelve month period, (ii) breach of
the Code of Conduct, (iii) declaration of unsound mind by a final order of
court, or (iv) conviction of a felony.


Active User Contributors (AUC)
==============================
Users are recognized as part of the community and therefore granted with
AUC (Active User Contributor) status when they have engaged in one or more of
the following activities:

* Organizers of Official OpenStack User Groups: `from the Groups Portal <https://github.com/OpenStackweb/openstack-org/blob/master/auc-metrics/code/services/OfficialUserGroupOrganizerService.php>`_
* Active members and contributors to functional teams and/or working groups (currently also manually calculated for WGs not using IRC): `from IRC logs <https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/uc-recognition/tree/tools/get_active_wg_members.py>`_
* Moderators of any of the operators official meet-up sessions: Currently manually calculated.
* Contributors to any repository under the UC governance: `from Gerrit <https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/uc-recognition/tree/tools/get_active_commiters.py>`_
* Track chairs for OpenStack summits: `from the Track Chair tool <https://github.com/OpenStackweb/openstack-org/blob/master/auc-metrics/code/services/TrackChairService.php>`_
* Contributors to Superuser (articles, interviews, user stories, etc.): `from the Superuser backend <https://github.com/OpenStackweb/openstack-org/blob/master/auc-metrics/code/services/SuperuserService.php>`_
* Active moderators on ask.openstack.org: `from Ask OpenStack <https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/uc-recognition/tree/tools/get_active_moderator.py>`_

UC Chair and Membership
=======================
The UC proposes one of its members to act as the UC chair. In the case of
multiple candidates, it may use a single-winner election method to decide the
result (see below). The Board of Directors has the authority to approve the UC
chair and shall approve the proposition, unless otherwise justified by its
bylaws. The UC chair is responsible for making sure meetings are held
according to the rules described below, and for communicating the decisions
taken during those meetings to the Board of Directors and the OpenStack
community at large. Any member of the UC, including the UC Chair, may be
revoked of its membership under the conditions described in the OpenStack
Foundation bylaws.

Meetings
========
UC meetings happen publicly, bi-weekly on IRC. The meeting times should be
decided among UC members. If there isn’t consensus on a meeting time, the
option of rotating the time weekly should be explored. The UC maintains an
open agenda on the wiki. The UC meeting is automatically called if anything
is posted to that wiki by one of its members at least one day before the
meeting time.  All functional teams and working groups leads are expected to
join or to send a representative at least quarterly with monthly preferred.
For a meeting to be actually held, at least half of the UC members need to be
present. Non-members affected by a given discussion are strongly encouraged
to participate in the meeting and voice their opinion, though only UC members
can ultimately cast a vote.

Motions
=======
Before being put to a vote, motions presented before the UC should be
discussed publicly on the UC mailing-list for a minimum of 4 business days
to give a chance to the wider community to express their opinion. UC members
can vote positively, negatively, or abstain. Decisions need more positive
votes than negative votes (ties mean the motion is rejected).

Proxying
========
When a UC member is unable to make a meeting, they are encouraged to name a
proxy that will represent their opinion and vote on their behalf during the
meeting. Only members really present at the meeting (directly or proxied) can
vote. A UC member may proxy another member, but nobody should ever represent
more than two votes.

Structure - Functional Teams
============================
These are defined as permanent teams as long as they maintain a meaningful
mission in order to help the UC to achieve its mission. The work of the
functional teams is performed under the oversight of the UC. The functional
teams are listed in Teams.

Structure - Working Groups
==========================
These are defined as temporary teams with medium-short term goals and they will
exist until they have achieved those. The work of the working groups is
performed under the oversight of the UC.

Process for Creating a New Working Group/Functional Team
========================================================
* `Complete Working Group Template
  <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Working_Group_Template>`_
* Join the `user-committee mailing list
  (user-committee@lists.openstack.org)
  <http://lists.openstack.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/user-committee>`_
  and communicate your intention to start a new team to the User
  Committee via the same mailing list.
* `Update UC wiki page with the entry for the new
  team. <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Governance/Foundation/UserCommittee>`_
* UC approves or denies the request before it becomes an active
  working group or functional team.

Committee Election
==================
The allotted number of UC seats are partially renewed every 6 months using
staggered elections: the minority number of seats are renewed every (Northern
hemisphere) Spring, and the majority number of seats are renewed every Fall.
Seats are valid for one-year terms. For this election we’ll use a single-winner
election system. The election is held no later than 3 weeks prior to each
OpenStack Summit, with elections held open for no less than four business days.

Filling Vacated UC Members
==========================
If a seat on the UC is vacated before the end of the term for which the member
was elected, the UC will select a replacement to serve out the remainder of
the term. The mechanism for selecting the replacement depends on when the seat
is vacated relative to the beginning of the candidacy period for the next
scheduled UC election. Selected candidates must meet all other constraints
for membership in the UC.

If the vacancy opens less than four weeks before the candidacy period
for the next scheduled UC election begins, and the seat vacated would
have been contested in the upcoming election anyway, then the seat
will remain open until the election and filled by the normal election
process.

If the vacancy opens less than four weeks before the candidacy period
or the next scheduled UC election begins and the seat would not have
been contested in the upcoming election, the candidates who do not win
seats in the election will be consulted in the order they appear in
the results until a candidate who is capable of serving agrees to
serve out the partial term.

If the vacancy opens with more than four weeks until the candidacy
period for the next scheduled UC election begins, regardless of
whether the vacated seat would have been contested in the next
election, the candidates who did not win seats in the most recent
previous UC election will be consulted in the order they appear in the
results until a candidate who is capable of serving agrees to serve
out the partial term.

Amendments
==========
Amendments to this UC charter shall be proposed in a special motion, which
needs to be approved by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the
total number of UC members.
