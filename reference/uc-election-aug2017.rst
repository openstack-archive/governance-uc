Elected Positions
=================
Under the rules of the UC charter, we need to elect 3 UC seats for this
election. Seats are valid for one-year term. User Committee member - 3
positions.

Electorate
==========
The electorate for this election are the Foundation individual members that
are also Active User Contributors (AUC) over the last six months.
The electorate is requested to confirm their email address and (if applicable) IRC handle
in their Foundation Member Profile, https://openstack.org/profile ,
prior to August 7, 2017 05:59 UTC so that the emailed ballots are mailed to the
correct email address.

Candidates
==========
Any individual member of the Foundation who is an Active User Contributor
(AUC) can propose their candidacy (except the two sitting UC members elected in
the previous election).

Self-nomination is common, no third party nomination is required. They do so by
sending an email to the user-committee@lists.openstack.org mailing-list, with
the subject: "UC candidacy" by August 11, 05:59 UTC. The email can include a
description of the candidate platform. The candidacy is then confirmed by
one of the election officials, after verification of the electorate status of
the candidate.
